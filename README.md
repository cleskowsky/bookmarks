# Bookmarks

I'd like to have a remote webapp I can trust to save bookmarks reliably that I can read on any of my devices.

I like Safari's reading list a lot, but sync just doesn't work between my ipad, iphone and Mac mini. Firefox seems to be ok between desktop computers but doesn't sync to my phone. Chrome smashes this out of the park, but Google is going down a road I don't really want to be on right now in terms of tracking, ad targeting and just advertising in general.
